##Usage

### Express
```javascript
  var appygram = require('appygram');
  ...
  //Make sure to use app.router; otherwise this middleware will not work
  app.use(app.router);
  appygram.setApiKey('your_api_key');
  app.use(appygram.errorHandler);
```

appygram lets you add a user object to the trace it sends. It defaults
to not sending a user object. To enable do
```javascript
appygram.include_user = true;
```
It defaults to the location of `req['user']`. To change this do
```javascript
appygram.user_location = "user_session_obj"
```
*Note* appygram only will support the user location if it is in the req
object.

To change the 'software' set with a trace object do
```javascript
appygram.app_name = "my awesome express app"
```
Otherwise it will default to "node application"

If you need to reset the appygram object for some reason a method is
exposed to handle this for you.
```javascript
appygram.reset_to_default();
```
You can see some basic examples here.
